    "#### Advanced Techniques\n",
    "- **Simultaneous Multithreading**: Allows multiple threads to run on a single CPU, improving utilization.\n",
    "- **Out-of-Order Execution**: Enables execution of instructions as soon as their operands are available, rather than strictly in the order they appear in the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Trends and Challenges\n",
    "- **Stagnation in Clock Speed and IPC**: Due to physical limitations in making transistors smaller.\n",
    "- **Multicore Architectures**: Incorporating multiple CPUs within a single unit to increase total capability without increasing individual CPU speed.\n",

    "\n",
    "Writing high performance code is only one part of being highly performant with successful projects over the longer term. Overall team velocity is far more important than speedups and complicated solutions. Several factors are key to thisâ€”good structure, documentation, debuggability, and shared standards.\n",
    "\n",
